            <h1>Downtown Lawrenceville</h1>
              <p>Historically significant buildings in downtown Lawrenceville 
                  include the Gwinnett Historic Courthouse and Lawrenceville 
                  Female Seminary. Also downtown are various landmarks and 
                  antique locations. Lawrenceville's revitalization plan was 
                  strengthened in 2005 when the city crafted a unique partnership 
                  with the Aurora Theatre (Gwinnett county's only professional theatre), 
                  which relocated from the nearby town of Duluth to a permanent 
                  site in downtown Lawrenceville in May 2007 for the opening of 
                  its eleventh season.</p>
