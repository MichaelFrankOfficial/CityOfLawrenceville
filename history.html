              <img src="images\Courthouse.jpg">
              <p>The Gwinnett Historic Courthouse is an historic 
                  government building located at 185 West Crogan Street 
                  in Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The original 
                  county courthouse burned in 1872. The present day Courthouse 
                  was built in 1885. It served as the center of county business 
                  for over a century. As the population of the county grew, 
                  the Courthouse could no longer handle all of the county's 
                  business. In 1988, Gwinnett County moved the majority of its 
                  operations into the new Justice and Administration Building 
                  located at 75 Langley Drive in Lawrenceville. The old Courthouse 
                  underwent a lengthy three year renovation starting in 1989. 
                  It reopened on July 3, 1992 as the Gwinnett Historic Courthouse. 
                  Today, it serves as a rental venue for weddings, concerts, 
                  conferences, and other special events.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwinnett_County_Courthouse">Wikipedia</a></p>
